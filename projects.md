## Open-source packages

- **[SSL4HFM](https://github.com/BehnoodRasti/SSL4HFM)** — Self-supervised learning package for hyperspectral foundation models. I developed the entire package. 
- **[FUnmix](https://github.com/BehnoodRasti/FUnmix)** — Fast semi-supervised unmixing Python package (two methods). Developed jointly with my PhD student.
- **[HySUPP](https://github.com/BehnoodRasti/HySUPP)** — Hyperspectral unmixing Python package (20 methods). Developed jointly with my PhD student.
- **[Unmixing Tutorial Package](https://github.com/BehnoodRasti/Unmixing_Tutorial_IEEE_IADF)** — Python package + Jupyter notebooks (incl. Colab) for seven unmixing methods. Developed jointly with my PhD student for my IEEE IADF unmixing tutorial.
- **[HyFTech](https://github.com/BehnoodRasti/HyFTech-Hyperspectral-Shallow-Deep-Feature-Extraction-Toolbox)** — Hyperspectral shallow & deep feature extraction toolbox (Python/Matlab), 15 methods. Developed with research collaborators.
- **[HyDe](https://github.com/Helmholtz-AI-Energy/HyDe)** — Python-based, GPU-accelerated hyperspectral denoising package. Developed by a HelmholtzAI researcher under my supervision.
- **[Hyperspectral Image Denoising Toolbox](https://openremotesensing.net/knowledgebase/noise-reduction-in-hyperspectral-imagery-overview-and-application/)** — Matlab toolbox developed by me (six hyperspectral denoising methods).
- **[Fast Wavelet Toolbox](https://github.com/BehnoodRasti/Wavelet-Toolbox-Wavelab_fast-)** — Fast wavelet toolbox for 1D/2D/3D signals, developed by me.
